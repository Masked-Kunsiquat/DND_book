# Core D&D Table Scenarios (Condensed)

Use these as UX friction probes.

---

## 1. Improvised Entity Creation (NPC / Location / Quest / Item)

Occurs when:
- Party talks to unplanned NPC
- DM invents a new place
- Side quest appears
- Important item is acquired

Needs:
- Quick capture of name + basic context
- Entity becomes relevant later in same session
- Players ask for details minutes or weeks later

---

## 2. Recall During Live Play

Players interrupt narration with:

- “What was their name again?”
- “Didn’t we already come here?”
- “Who promised us that?”

DM must quickly retrieve:
- prior encounters
- relationships
- location history
- past decisions

Happens while talking.

---

## 3. Sudden Combat / Scene Shift

Combat or parallel scenes begin unexpectedly.

DM must:
- track turns / HP / conditions
- manage multiple locations or party splits
- keep narrative continuity

No prep beforehand.

---

## 4. Meaningful Player Choice

Player does something with long-term impact:

- betrayal
- pact
- promise
- destruction
- alliance

DM thinks: “this matters later.”

Needs to be captured fast.

---

## 5. Session Wrap-Up

End of night.

DM wants to record:
- major events
- new NPCs / locations
- unresolved threads
- next-session hooks

Low energy, minimal structure tolerance.

---

## 6. Between-Session Prep

DM reviews:
- loose ends
- ongoing consequences
- NPC motivations
- upcoming locations

Adds secrets, plans, refinements.

Different mindset than live play.

---

## 7. Session Restart / Recap

Start of next session.

Players ask:
- what happened last time
- what are we doing
- what’s still unresolved

DM needs fast narrative refresh.

---

## 8. Long-Term Consequence Tracking

Across many sessions:

- grudges
- favors owed
- political fallout
- reputation changes
- callbacks to old events

Slow-burn story continuity.

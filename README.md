# DND Book

## 📌 Project Overview
DND Book is a **campaign management application** designed for Dungeon Masters and players to organize notes, NPCs, locations, and other key details of their tabletop RPG adventures. The project is built on **PocketBase** for backend storage and authentication, with a **React-based frontend powered by Vite**.

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide an **overview dashboard** summarizing campaign data.
- Allow filtering by **specific campaigns** across all entities (notes, NPCs, locations, etc.).
- Store and retrieve data efficiently via **PocketBase**.
- Ensure a **smooth, responsive UI** using **React, TailwindCSS, and Flowbite**.
- Support authentication and user-specific data with **secure token storage**.
- Implement a **global campaign selector** that persists across all pages.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, TailwindCSS, Flowbite
- **Backend:** PocketBase (self-hosted)
- **Authentication:** PocketBase user auth system
